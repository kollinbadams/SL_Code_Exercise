Sales Loft App - Initial Thoughts

Environment is working and set up following the getting started instructions.

Using Windows Subsytem to run Ubuntu.

Insert API Key to .Env File

Based on the API Documentation, I will need to add Authorization headers
and URL paths to access the API Data


Level 1:
Landing page that pulls "people" data from the API. 
Display in an HTML grid, unless the API can display it natively in a pretty format.
Will need a Controller, a Model, and a View. 
Controller - sends request to fetch data from API
Model - tells how to form the data that is received in a response 
 ->Name (First and Last?)
 ->Email Address
 ->Job Title
View - displays the resulting data.
