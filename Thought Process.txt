Sales Loft App - Initial Thoughts

Environment is working and set up following the getting started instructions.

Using Windows Subsytem to run Ubuntu.

Insert API Key to .Env File

Based on the API Documentation, I will need to add Authorization headers
and URL paths to access the API Data


Level 1:
Landing page that pulls "people" data from the API. 
Display in an HTML grid, unless the API can display it natively in a pretty format.
Will need a Controller, a Model, and a View. 
Controller - sends request to fetch data from API
Model - tells how to form the data that is received in a response 
 ->Name (First and Last?)
 ->Email Address
 ->Job Title
View - displays the resulting data.

Files Needed:
client/src/components/People.js -> for the main people page logic
client/src/components/PeopleTable.js -> for formatting the data into a table
app/models/people.rb -> to add the API connection/authorization info, and to create a data getter, instruct how to form data
app/controllers/api/people_controller.rb -> handle the api response
